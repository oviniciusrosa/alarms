## Techs and Patterns

Basically here we used Flutter to handle the interface and the animations. Talking about animations, in this project we used [Flutter Animated](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_animate) to handle entrances and micro interactions. We have drift handling the data store and event channels to deal with the native code. For the architecture we used Bloc to manage the data flux.

## How to run

Clone this project. To guarantee that everything is fine, run the follow code in terminal:

> `flutter pub get`

Then, with the emulator open, execute:

> `flutter run`

Enjoy 😉
